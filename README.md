Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org. This will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which is required to manage dependencies.

To verify the installation, run the following commands in your terminal:

bash
Copy
node -v
npm -v
These commands should display the installed versions of Node.js and npm.

Steps to Set Up the Project

bash
Copy
npm install
Start the Development Server:
